## Completed - CyberNova Academy -100% Hands-On Cohort Training:(Cybersecurity SOC & GRC)
CyberNova Academy’s SOC & GRC Cohort is 100% hands-on, job-ready program designed to help learners build real SOC analyst capability (detection, triage, investigation, response) and GRC capability (risk, compliance, ISO 27001, Essential Eight alignment, audit readiness).  

Learners graduate with:
- A GitHub portfolio with practical SOC labs and write-ups.
- Evidence of detection engineering (KQL/SPL, dashboards, alerts, use cases).
- Incident response workflow experience (tickets, cases, playbooks, reports).
- GRC artifacts (risk register, policies, ISMS scope, audit evidence pack).
- Real-world tooling familiarity (SIEM (Splunk, Wazuh, Microsoft Sentinel), EDR/XDR ( Defender for Endpoint, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike), SOAR (Splunk Soar/Microsoft Sentinel Soar), threat intel, Vulnerability Management Tools (Tenable, Rapid 7 and Open VAS).

## About Omotayo Akande , SOC & GRC Professional
As a SOC and GRC-focused cybersecurity professional, I work at the intersection of technical detection/response and governance-driven risk management.
My interests include building SOC workflows, designing detections in SIEM platforms, and creating governance artifacts that map security controls to business risk and compliance requirements.

What I focus on:
- Hands-on SOC skills: log analysis, alert triage, threat hunting, and incident response in enterprise-style environments.
- GRC capability: risk assessments, control design, ISO 27001 and Essential Eight alignment, policy and audit preparation.
- Career development: building a strong portfolio on GitHub, documenting labs clearly, and continuously improving technical and governance skills.

## Objective
My objective is to build a career as a SOC and GRC professional, contributing to detection, response, and governance in modern enterprises.
I am particularly interested in Tier 1/Tier 2 SOC analyst roles and junior GRC analyst roles where I can apply detection engineering, incident handling, and risk management to help organisations strengthen their security posture.

## How to Use This Repo
1. Create a GitHub repository named exactly your GitHub username (for example, `AugustineEdeh`) so this README becomes your profile page. [web:16]  
2. Replace placeholder links (`yourusername`, example URLs) with your actual repositories and resources.  
3. Add screenshots to an `/images` directory and reference them in this README.  
4. Each week, add:
   - 1 lab write-up.
   - 1 detection or hunt query.
   - 1 short reflection (“What I learned”). [web:19]
